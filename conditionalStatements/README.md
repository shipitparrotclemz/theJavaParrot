In this second newsletter, we will be exploring Conditional Statements in Java!

A conditional statement is a fancy way of saying “if this, then that.” It allows you to make decisions and take different actions based on specified conditions.

## Running the code

Step 1: Install the latest Java version on your machine.

Step 2: Compile the file. This will give you a compiled JVM bytecode file (`ConditionalStatements.class`)

```
// List files
➜  conditionalStatements git:(master) ✗ ls
ConditionalStatements.java         README.md

// Compile `ConditionalStatements.java`; This will give us ConditionalStatements.class 
javac ConditionalStatements.java

// List files again, after compiling. We should now see ConditionalStatements.class
➜  conditionalStatements git:(master) ✗ ls
ConditionalStatements.class        ConditionalStatements.java         README.md
```

Step 3: Run the compiled class file

```
➜  conditionalStatements git:(master) ✗ java ConditionalStatements
